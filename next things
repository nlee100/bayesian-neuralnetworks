##what next?
(1) Update images with captions and link them within the text
(2) Link citations and have only 1 citation for an article cited more than once
(3) Add some bright images to reduce the dull theme like the basic neural image
(4) all the remaining sections under applications!

You can add anything here and then mark as done if you have done it. Will do so too.
Also renaming our file to something other than README.md will fail to render in gh pages. we dont want that
##cheers!!
